                    the foundation of our ideas is based on psychology. we use science to form the whole program which
                    can benefit our clients in a meaningful way. yogym has its own unique approach to fitness and
                    mental strength. yogym brings the best to its clients who are looking for a real change. we believe
                    ourselves as more of a paradigm than a market.
